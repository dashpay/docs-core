==================
Dash Documentation
==================

Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features instant transaction
confirmation, double spend protection, optional privacy equal to that of
physical cash, a self-governing, and a self-funding model driven by incentivized
full nodes. While Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key
components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers
significant improvements in transaction speed, privacy and governance. This
section of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set
Dash apart in the blockchain economy.
